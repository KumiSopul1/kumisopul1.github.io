            <h1>Most popular series</h1>
            <div>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-0xollWZ9Bo" target="videoplayer">Batman has a Drinking Problem</a> This always catches me off guard in terms of how funny it is, because there’s a real honesty to the Batman character, just kind of falling apart right before the eyes of the commissioner and Robin.</p>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/nMMxIAn_76g" target="videoplayer">ShamWow Guy in Jail</a> This is just hilarious although the ShamWow guy did apparently assault someone so also a little sad in retrospect but it’s just a little mad, just someone refusing to accept his reality.</p>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/n0_-aVaEyP8" target="videoplayer">CSI: Scooby Doo</a> Takes Scooby Doo to its inevitable darker conclusion and absolutely love it. Check this video out now.</p>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kedjhnguKhc" target="videoplayer">RPG Heroes are Jerks</a>I love RPGs and even I can agree that from the outside, your Journey is unnamed hero must be awful for the NPCs and this CollegeHumor video highlights this in a very funny way.</p>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/AVl8vfev4L8" target="videoplayer">Sim City Mayor</a>Is dark and funny and also really made me want to go back and play Sim City, it has the actor whom I exclusively think of as the CollegeHumor Dad.</p>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eExfV_xKaiM" target="videoplayer">Nicolas Cage's Agent</a>I struggled with whether to include this one or the Chris Brown one, in the end I decided I didn’t want to passively support someone who assaults women so I went with good ol’ Nick Cage. Either way you get a long suffering agent dealing with the foibles of his client.</p>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/aQTJl2bwoZQ" target="videoplayer">31 Words That Sound Like Slurs but Arent't</a>I think I can honestly get behind anything, whether it’s silly or as potentially offensive as this video if it’s presented to me as a song because catchy songs just get stuck in my head.</p>
